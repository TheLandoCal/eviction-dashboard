# Cape Fear Collective: Hack for Housing - Eviction Dashboard

Build an eviction dashboard for policy-makers, residents, and/or community advocates. Your dashboard may examine racial or other disparities in evictions, provide maps of areas most subject to eviction, and/or provide resources for residents facing eviction.

# Data

This dashboard was built using data collected from [Eviction Lab - New Hanover County, NC](https://evictionlab.org/map/#/2016?geography=counties&bounds=-78.582,33.87,-77.163,34.447&type=er&locations=37129,-77.873,34.159)

# Upcoming Features

- **Data Dashboard**: A series of data and charts to help Policy Makers and Influencers decide what efforts can decrease evictions and cost-burdens for residents.
- **Resident Resources**: A collection of programs and advice to provide guidance when facing eviction.
- **Updates Subscription**: A service to provide advocates and residents with up-to-date information on current housing programs available in their community.
